										<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Many Duolingo users express frustration online, feeling that they haven’t made meaningful progress on the app or learned practical language skills they can apply in real-life situations.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>2. Hypothesis</h2>
									</header>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Primary Hypothesis:</b> Introducing a "Vacation Preparation" module focused on travel-specific conversations will significantly improve user confidence and retention rates among casual learners.</li>
										<li><b>Supporting Hypotheses:</b> <ul>
											<li>Users will feel more prepared and confident when practicing travel-related conversations.</li>
											<li>This module could increase overall user engagement and reduce app churn for beginners.</li>
											<li>Offering this feature as a premium module might increase subscription rates.</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Explanation for Hypothesis: </b>User claims most likely stem from limited usage, a strong likelihood to quit, and an inability to recite useful phrases when needed.</p>
									<p>This feature aims to assuage these concerns in a multitude of ways</p>
									<ul><li>Lessons containing common interactions intrigue the average learner more than a  grammar-focused approach </li>
										<li>Fun and relevant lessons that stick in someone’s mind are strong incentives to return and continue using Duolingo</li>
										<li>When prompted by friends or engaged in a common scenario (ordering coffee) a user can easily bring up their knowledge. </li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>What gap does this feature address?</b></p>
									<p>Current Duolingo lessons focus on broader language skills and long-term learning, but there’s a lack of context-specific modules to prepare users for regular conversations. The gap is between theoretical knowledge and practical, real-world application for beginners/intermediates.</p>
									<p><b>Target Audience:</b> Identify who would benefit from this feature.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Target demographic: New language learners who want a crash course in conversation basics for their vacations.
											<ul><li>Age: 22 - 50</li>
											<li>Gender: All</li>
											<li>Location: Canada & United States</li>
											<li>Income Level: Mid to High earners</li></ul>
										</li>
										<li>Focus on B2C users who are casual learners (tourists, business travellers, digital nomads).</li>
									</ul>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>3. Market Research</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Research to understand the potential demand for this feature:</p>
									<p><b>Competitor Analysis:</b> Using a feature table I will compare and contrast apps like Babbel or Rosetta Stone to compare their travel-focused material and how they approach real-world language use.</p>

									<p><i>Expanded Information:</i></p>
									<p>Babbel:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Upon starting a course, users are asked to select their primary motivation for learning. If “vacation” is chosen, they are informed that the course includes over 15 hours of travel-specific French lessons.</li>
										<li>Babbel Live offers users the opportunity to converse with real teachers on topics of personal interest, allowing for targeted, practical learning.</li>
										<li>While Babbel does offer a free version, it provides access to only a single lesson per language, functioning more as a trial rather than a fully usable free plan.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Rosetta Stone:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Rosetta Stone, like Duolingo, begins its language courses with a strong focus on foundational grammar.</li>
										<li>Rosetta Stone offers the ability to leave the structured lesson plan, allowing them to explore and engage with courses that match their interests.</li>
										<li>Rosetta Stone provides live lessons and instructor-led sessions for a more interactive learning experience.</li>

										<h2>5. Feature Ideation and Requirements</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Outlining the Vacation Preparation feature’s details:</p>
									<ul><li><b>Feature Scope:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Common travel scenarios that will have tailored lessons:
            <ul>
                <li>Ordering at a restaurant</li>
                <li>Asking for directions</li>
                <li>Booking a hotel room/hotel check-out </li>
                <li>Handling emergencies</li>
                <li>Sightseeing (asking for a museum map, asking about hours, asking for English options)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This feature would include <b>listening comprehension</b> and <b>speaking practice</b> focused on natural, real-world conversations.
            <ul>
                <li>Additionally, an option for later is to incorporate background noise increasing the difficulty</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
									<li><b>Core Features:</b>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Interactive Dialogues:</b> Users can role-play conversations with a chatbot that mimics native speakers.</li>
											<li><b>Quick Practice Mode:</b> A feature that allows users to do a 5-minute travel-related vocabulary recap</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
										<li><b>User Flow:</b>
											<ul>
												<li>Users would select a practice tab, then vacation prep, then a specific travel context (e.g., restaurant, airport) and finally engage with the role-play character.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>6. Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This strategy does not align with Duolingo’s current approach - with that said, I would collaborate to determine the best way to incorporate these ideas.</p>
									<ul><li><b>MVP (Minimum Viable Product):</b>
									<ul>
										<li>Roll out the Vacation Preparation feature for one or two popular languages (e.g., Spanish, French) 
										</li>
									</ul></li>
									<li><b>Marketing Strategy:</b>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Target Audience:</b> 
											<ul>
												<li>Run targeted ads for people within the demographic who have been researching one of the Vacation Preparation Languages. Focus geographics in an affluent area with strong first adopter likelihood (San Francisco, New York, etc.)</li>
												<li>Create in-app notifications promoting the feature to users showing interest in learning for travel (data can be pulled from user behaviour patterns).</li>
											</ul></li>
										</ul>
									</li>
										<li><b>Monetization:</b>
											<ul>
												<li>Duo Free
												<ul><li>Free users would have access to three lessons before being prompted to upgrade.</li></ul></li>
												<li>Duo Plus
												<ul><li>Plus users would enjoy pre-scripted travel interactions, similar to podcast episodes, covering scenarios like ordering at a restaurant, asking for directions, or checking into a hotel.</li></ul></li>
												<li>Duo Max
												<ul><li>Max users would experience more immersive simulations. For instance, they might be tasked with buying a train ticket, provided with their destination, and then walk through the steps of purchasing tickets. This interactive experience would help build confidence for when they encounter similar situations during their actual travels.</li></ul></li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><b>Monetization:</b><ul>
											<li><b>User Engagement:</b> How many users complete the vacation lessons and their time spent in the module.</li>
											<li><b>Churn Reduction:</b> Measure if new users (and existing users) who start the Vacation Preparation module are less likely to leave the platform.</li>
											<li><b>Customer Satisfaction:</b> Survey users post-module to assess if they feel more confident using their language skills in real-life travel situations.</li>
										</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>7. Iteration and Feedback Loop</h2>
									</header>
									<p>After launching the feature:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>User Feedback:</b> Gather feedback from early users to understand what’s working and what isn’t.</li>
											<li><b>Continuous Improvement:</b> Use A/B testing to compare conversation scenarios, UI layouts, and feedback mechanisms to see which resonates better with users.</li>
											<li><b>New Languages & Expansions:</b> As the feature succeeds, expand it to additional languages and other travel contexts.</li>
									</ul>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>8. Impact Analysis</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Evaluate the success of the feature:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Engagement Growth:</b> Measure increases in daily active users (DAU) or session length among users who utilize the feature.</li>
											<li><b>Revenue Impact:</b> Assess whether offering this feature as part of Duolingo Plus led to an increase in subscriptions or premium feature purchases.</li>
											<li><b>User Retention:</b> Analyze whether the vacation preparation feature helped reduce churn among casual learners who typically use the app and then leave.</li>
