										<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Many Duolingo users express frustration online, feeling that they haven’t made meaningful progress on the app or learned practical language skills they can apply in real-life situations.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>2. Hypothesis</h2>
									</header>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Primary Hypothesis:</b> Introducing a "Vacation Preparation" module focused on travel-specific conversations will significantly improve user confidence and retention rates among casual learners.</li>
										<li><b>Supporting Hypotheses:</b> <ul>
											<li>Users will feel more prepared and confident when practicing travel-related conversations.</li>
											<li>This module could increase overall user engagement and reduce app churn for beginners.</li>
											<li>Offering this feature as a premium module might increase subscription rates.</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Explanation for Hypothesis: </b>User claims most likely stem from limited usage, a strong likelihood to quit, and an inability to recite useful phrases when needed.</p>
									<p>This feature aims to assuage these concerns in a multitude of ways</p>
									<ul><li>Lessons containing common interactions intrigue the average learner more than a  grammar-focused approach </li>
										<li>Fun and relevant lessons that stick in someone’s mind are strong incentives to return and continue using Duolingo</li>
										<li>When prompted by friends or engaged in a common scenario (ordering coffee) a user can easily bring up their knowledge. </li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>What gap does this feature address?</b></p>
									<p>Current Duolingo lessons focus on broader language skills and long-term learning, but there’s a lack of context-specific modules to prepare users for regular conversations. The gap is between theoretical knowledge and practical, real-world application for beginners/intermediates.</p>
									<p><b>Target Audience:</b> Identify who would benefit from this feature.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Target demographic: New language learners who want a crash course in conversation basics for their vacations.
											<ul><li>Age: 22 - 50</li>
											<li>Gender: All</li>
											<li>Location: Canada & United States</li>
											<li>Income Level: Mid to High earners</li></ul
										</li>
										<li>Focus on B2C users who are casual learners (tourists, business travellers, digital nomads).</li>
									</ul>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>3. Market Research</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Research to understand the potential demand for this feature:</p>
									<p><b>Competitor Analysis:</b> Using a feature table I will compare and contrast apps like Babbel or Rosetta Stone to compare their travel-focused material and how they approach real-world language use.</p>

									<p><i>Expanded Information:</i></p>
									<p>Babbel:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Upon starting a course, users are asked to select their primary motivation for learning. If “vacation” is chosen, they are informed that the course includes over 15 hours of travel-specific French lessons.</li>
										<li>Babbel Live offers users the opportunity to converse with real teachers on topics of personal interest, allowing for targeted, practical learning.</li>
										<li>While Babbel does offer a free version, it provides access to only a single lesson per language, functioning more as a trial rather than a fully usable free plan.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Rosetta Stone:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Rosetta Stone, like Duolingo, begins its language courses with a strong focus on foundational grammar.</li>
										<li>Rosetta Stone offers the ability to leave the structured lesson plan, allowing them to explore and engage with courses that match their interests.</li>
										<li>Rosetta Stone provides live lessons and instructor-led sessions for a more interactive learning experience.</li>
